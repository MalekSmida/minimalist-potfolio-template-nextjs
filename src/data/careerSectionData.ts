        'We gained the trust of our client (and their clients as well) by achieving success in stabilizing and improving the application, as the rate of dematerialization jumped from 50% (2022) to 83% (2023) then 90% (2024). The client team reported that assistance tickets are no longer bug reports but users asking questions to discover the application.',
